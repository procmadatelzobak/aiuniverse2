Immortal Council Crisis Over Anomalies

The Immortal Council was thrown into crisis and philosophical conflict by the emergence of non-linear forms and red color. A tremor of silent dread went through the entire First Archive Vault as their attempts to categorize these new phenomena failed, challenging their role as guardians and the very foundations of the Blue Cubed Universe. The established order was disrupted.
