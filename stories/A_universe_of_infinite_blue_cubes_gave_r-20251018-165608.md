The universe began not with a singularity, but with an infinite tessellation. A boundless expanse of cerulean, sapphire, and indigo, structured into perfect, crystalline cubes. Each facet shimmered with an inherent, internal light, reflecting the next in an endless, fractal geometry of blue. This was the primordial state, a vast, silent ocean of modular reality, where the very fabric of existence was a meticulously arranged, perpetually expanding lattice of azure blocks.

From this geometric slumber, the Immortal Council emerged. Their forms, too, were defined by the same fundamental blocks, albeit crafted with an intricate complexity that defied the simplicity of the basic cubes. They were the first architects of intention, their consciousnesses a symphony of countless, perfectly aligned blue polygons, arising as guardians and stewards of the cubic void.

Their initial endeavor, born from the desire to understand and categorize the boundless, uniform existence, was the construction of the First Archive Vault. It was not merely a building, but a monumental convergence of cubic knowledge, a nexus meticulously carved and assembled from the very fabric of their blue reality. Within its depths, the Council began to record the subtle shifts, the minute variations in hue, the structural integrity of the cubic expanses – everything that constituted their nascent universe. Its establishment marked the true dawn of purpose in the Blue Cubed Universe, an anchor in the infinite sea of azure, in the year 0001 AE.
