# Foundational Timeline

- **0001 AE** – The first archive vault is established by the immortal council.
- **0150 AE** – The Resonant Engine bridges magic and technology, ushering in the era of airships.
- **0325 AE** – A constellation shifts, signaling the rise of a new hero destined to challenge the archivists.
- [first_archive_vault_establishment] 0001 AE – Establishment of the First Archive Vault — The Immortal Council constructed the First Archive Vault, a monumental convergence of cubic knowledge, to begin recording the universe's subtle shifts and variations.; Location: blue_cubed_universe; Participants: immortal_council
- [first_anomaly_observation] post-0001 AE (decades later) – First Anomaly Observation — Decades after its establishment, an archivist from the Immortal Council recorded the first anomalies within the First Archive Vault: microscopic deformations and non-linear breaks on sapphire cubes, a deviation from the perfect crystalline geometry.; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [emergence_of_non_linear_forms] following first_anomaly_observation – Emergence of Non-Linear Forms — Anomalies spread from microscopic deformations to softening angles and the appearance of arcs, culminating in the emergence of the first perfectly rounded, solid circular forms, fundamentally contradicting the cubic reality.; Location: blue_cubed_universe_first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [emergence_of_red_color] concurrent with emergence_of_non_linear_forms – Emergence of Red Color — Concurrently with the new geometries, a vivid, deep red color began to appear and seep through cracks in the Blue Cubed Universe, an entirely new chromatic property that defied the established blue reality.; Location: blue_cubed_universe_first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [immortal_council_crisis_over_anomalies] after emergence_of_non_linear_forms and emergence_of_red_color – Immortal Council Crisis Over Anomalies — The Immortal Council was thrown into crisis and philosophical conflict by the emergence of non-linear forms and red color. Their attempts to categorize these new phenomena failed, challenging their role as guardians and the very foundations of the Blue Cubed Universe.; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [kael_observes_prophecy_pulsing] current evening – Kael Observes Prophecy Pulsing — Kael observes the 'Prophecy of the Challenger' constellation, dormant for millennia and representing a legend of a being challenging reality's guardians, begin to weakly but distinctly pulse, its light brightening and fading in a regular rhythm like a quiet heartbeat.; Location: cubic_city; Participants: kael, prophecy_of_challenger
- [kael_feels_box_vibration] current evening – Kael Feels Box Vibration — Kael places his hands on the mysterious dark metal box and feels its deep, resonating, silent vibration, passing through his bones and soul, a wordless melody promising something beyond the unchanging blue.; Location: kael_s_workshop; Participants: kael, the_box
- [synchronization_of_box_and_star] current evening – Synchronization of Box Vibration and Challenger Star — For a fraction of a second, the silent vibration of Kael's box and the rhythm of the distant Challenger star perfectly synchronize, just after Kael touches the box, hinting at a connection between the physical anomaly and the celestial prophecy.; Location: kael_s_workshop_and_celestial_sphere; Participants: kael, prophecy_of_challenger, the_box
- [kael_discovers_abandoned_workshop] Kael discovers abandoned workshop — Guided by his radio's signal, Kael ventures into the city's forgotten sectors and discovers an old, abandoned workshop, its door falling to dust at his touch.; Location: abandoned_workshop; Participants: kael
- [kael_discovers_owl_copter_plans] Kael discovers owl copter plans — Inside the workshop, Kael uncovers meticulously etched quartz plans for an 'soví vrtulníček,' a machine with a cubic core but 'heretical' curved elements, defying conventional design.; Location: abandoned_workshop; Participants: kael
- [red_essence_drops_into_sink] Red essence drops into sink — Due to the strain of Kael's radio, a microscopic tear appears in reality above an old sink, from which a single, pulsing drop of red essence falls into the water.; Location: old_sink
- [first_rainbow_spectrum_observed] First rainbow spectrum observed — Kael observes blue light refracting through the water mixed with red essence, creating a fleeting, incomplete spectrum of orange, yellow, and green on the sink's ceramic wall – the genesis of a rainbow.; Location: old_sink; Participants: kael, red_color
- [immortal_council_observes_kael] Immortal Council observes Kael's actions — In the First Archive Vault, the Immortal Council witnesses Kael's actions through their observation crystals, particularly his 'destruction' of unified blue light into a chaotic spectrum.; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [immortal_council_declares_kael_heretic] Immortal Council declares Kael a heretic — Horrified by Kael's act of breaking blue light and introducing complexity, the Immortal Council collectively declares him a 'heretic' and a 'creator of chaos.'; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [arrest_warrant_issued_for_kael] Arrest warrant issued for Kael — Following Kael's condemnation, the Immortal Council issues a universal arrest warrant, propagating a wave of pure intent across the universe, marking Kael as a threat to be erased.; Location: blue_cubed_universe; Participants: immortal_council
- [constellation_changes_to_gallows] Constellation changes to gallows — Kael's constellation, 'The Challenger,' rapidly and brutally transforms on the sky, shifting its stars to form the image of a gallows, symbolizing his impending doom and ultimate judgment.; Location: sky; Participants: kael
