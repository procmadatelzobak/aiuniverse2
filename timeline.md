# Foundational Timeline

- **0001 AE** – The first archive vault is established by the immortal council.
- **0150 AE** – The Resonant Engine bridges magic and technology, ushering in the era of airships.
- **0325 AE** – A constellation shifts, signaling the rise of a new hero destined to challenge the archivists.
- [first_archive_vault_establishment] 0001 AE – Establishment of the First Archive Vault — The Immortal Council constructed the First Archive Vault, a monumental convergence of cubic knowledge, to begin recording the universe's subtle shifts and variations.; Location: blue_cubed_universe; Participants: immortal_council
- [first_anomaly_observation] post-0001 AE (decades later) – First Anomaly Observation — Decades after its establishment, an archivist from the Immortal Council recorded the first anomalies within the First Archive Vault: microscopic deformations and non-linear breaks on sapphire cubes, a deviation from the perfect crystalline geometry.; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [emergence_of_non_linear_forms] following first_anomaly_observation – Emergence of Non-Linear Forms — Anomalies spread from microscopic deformations to softening angles and the appearance of arcs, culminating in the emergence of the first perfectly rounded, solid circular forms, fundamentally contradicting the cubic reality.; Location: blue_cubed_universe_first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [emergence_of_red_color] concurrent with emergence_of_non_linear_forms – Emergence of Red Color — Concurrently with the new geometries, a vivid, deep red color began to appear and seep through cracks in the Blue Cubed Universe, an entirely new chromatic property that defied the established blue reality.; Location: blue_cubed_universe_first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [immortal_council_crisis_over_anomalies] after emergence_of_non_linear_forms and emergence_of_red_color – Immortal Council Crisis Over Anomalies — The Immortal Council was thrown into crisis and philosophical conflict by the emergence of non-linear forms and red color. Their attempts to categorize these new phenomena failed, challenging their role as guardians and the very foundations of the Blue Cubed Universe.; Location: first_archive_vault; Participants: immortal_council
- [kael_observes_prophecy_pulsing] current evening – Kael Observes Prophecy Pulsing — Kael observes the 'Prophecy of the Challenger' constellation, dormant for millennia and representing a legend of a being challenging reality's guardians, begin to weakly but distinctly pulse, its light brightening and fading in a regular rhythm like a quiet heartbeat.; Location: cubic_city; Participants: kael, prophecy_of_challenger
- [kael_feels_box_vibration] current evening – Kael Feels Box Vibration — Kael places his hands on the mysterious dark metal box and feels its deep, resonating, silent vibration, passing through his bones and soul, a wordless melody promising something beyond the unchanging blue.; Location: kael_s_workshop; Participants: kael, the_box
- [synchronization_of_box_and_star] current evening – Synchronization of Box Vibration and Challenger Star — For a fraction of a second, the silent vibration of Kael's box and the rhythm of the distant Challenger star perfectly synchronize, just after Kael touches the box, hinting at a connection between the physical anomaly and the celestial prophecy.; Location: kael_s_workshop_and_celestial_sphere; Participants: kael, prophecy_of_challenger, the_box
